Hi Sarah, I completely understand how frustrating this billing issue must be for you. 
I'm here to help resolve this quickly and make sure it doesn't happen again.

I've reviewed your account and found the duplicate charge from our system update last week. 
I've already processed a full refund that should appear in your account within 2-3 business days.

As a solution, I've also added a note to your account to prevent future billing issues, 
and I'll personally follow up with you on Friday to ensure everything is resolved.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?
