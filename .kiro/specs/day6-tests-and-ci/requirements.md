# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Day 6 focuses on implementing comprehensive testing and continuous integration for ClarityAI. This phase will establish test coverage of ≥80%, set up GitHub Actions CI, and ensure code quality and reliability across the entire codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Test Suite

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to ClarityAI, I want comprehensive test coverage so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL achieve ≥80% code coverage across all modules
2. WHEN unit tests execute THEN they SHALL cover all core functions in scorer, template, and trainer modules
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL verify end-to-end functionality of CLI commands
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL complete in under 2 minutes for the full suite
5. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN they SHALL include invalid inputs, missing files, and error conditions

### Requirement 2: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated CI/CD so that all pull requests are automatically tested before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to any branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically run the test suite
2. WHEN a pull request is created THEN CI SHALL run tests and report status
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the CI pipeline SHALL prevent merging and show clear error messages
4. WHEN CI runs THEN it SHALL test against Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
5. WHEN CI completes successfully THEN it SHALL generate and upload coverage reports

### Requirement 3: Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a user of ClarityAI, I want assurance that all components work together correctly so that the tool functions reliably in real scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL verify the complete scoring workflow
2. WHEN training integration tests execute THEN they SHALL confirm reward improvement over multiple steps
3. WHEN CLI integration tests run THEN they SHALL test all commands with various parameter combinations
4. WHEN Streamlit integration tests execute THEN they SHALL verify UI functionality
5. WHEN file I/O tests run THEN they SHALL test template loading, saving, and ledger management

### Requirement 4: Performance and Quality Tests

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want ClarityAI to maintain good performance characteristics so that it scales well with larger workloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN scoring 100 texts SHALL complete in under 10 seconds
2. WHEN memory tests execute THEN peak memory usage SHALL not exceed 1GB during training
3. WHEN code quality checks run THEN they SHALL enforce consistent formatting and style
4. WHEN security tests execute THEN they SHALL identify potential vulnerabilities
5. WHEN dependency tests run THEN they SHALL verify all required packages are properly specified

### Requirement 5: Test Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a new contributor, I want clear testing documentation so that I can understand how to run tests and add new ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developers read the README THEN it SHALL include clear instructions for running tests
2. WHEN new tests are added THEN they SHALL follow established patterns and conventions
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
4. WHEN tests are maintained THEN they SHALL be kept up-to-date with code changes
5. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN they SHALL highlight areas needing more tests
