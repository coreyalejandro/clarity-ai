## 🛠️ Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Define Quality Criteria

Work with your best support agents to identify what makes excellent customer service:

```yaml
name: customer_support_excellence
description: Evaluates customer support responses for helpfulness, professionalism, and effectiveness

rules:
  # Empathy and Understanding
  - type: contains_phrase
    weight: 3.0
    params:
      phrase: "understand"
  
  - type: contains_phrase
    weight: 2.5
    params:
      phrase: "help"
  
  # Professional Tone
  - type: sentiment_positive
    weight: 2.0
    params: {}
  
  # Appropriate Length
  - type: word_count
    weight: 1.5
    params:
      min_words: 30
      max_words: 200
  
  # Solution-Oriented
  - type: contains_phrase
    weight: 2.0
    params:
      phrase: "solution"
  
  # Follow-up Commitment
  - type: regex_match
    weight: 1.5
    params:
      pattern: "(follow.up|get back|check on|update you)"
  
  # Readability
  - type: readability
    weight: 1.0
    params:
      target_grade_level: 8
      tolerance: 2
```

### Step 2: Test with Historical Data

Use your best and worst support responses to validate the rubric:

**Excellent Response Example:**
```
Hi Sarah,

I understand how frustrating this billing issue must be for you. I'm here to help resolve this quickly.

I've reviewed your account and found the problem - there was a duplicate charge from our system update last week. I've already processed a full refund that should appear in your account within 2-3 business days.

To prevent this from happening again, I've added a note to your account and our billing team will monitor it closely. I'll also follow up with you on Friday to make sure the refund processed correctly.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

Best regards,
Mike
```

**ClarityAI Score:** 0.89 ✅

**Poor Response Example:**
```
The billing issue is a known problem. Check your account in a few days.
```

**ClarityAI Score:** 0.12 ❌

### Step 3: Train Your AI Model

```bash
# Install ClarityAI
pip install -e .

# Train model with your support rubric
clarity train --model microsoft/DialoGPT-medium \
              --template customer-support.yaml \
              --steps 100 \
              --output models/support-ai
```

### Step 4: Integration & Deployment

**API Integration Example:**
```python
from clarity.scorer import Template
import openai

# Load your trained model and rubric
template = Template.from_yaml("customer-support.yaml")

def generate_support_response(customer_message):
    # Generate response with your trained model
    response = your_trained_model.generate(customer_message)
    
    # Score the response
    score = template.evaluate(response)
    
    # Only use high-quality responses
    if score >= 0.7:
        return response
    else:
        # Regenerate or escalate to human
        return generate_alternative_response(customer_message)
```
