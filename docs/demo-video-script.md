# ClarityAI Demo Video Script
## "From PhD to High School: Making AI Fine-Tuning Accessible"

**Duration:** 5-7 minutes  
**Target Audience:** Developers, ML Engineers, Product Managers, Domain Experts  
**Goal:** Show how ClarityAI democratizes fine-tuning while providing enterprise-grade results

---

## üé¨ Scene 1: The Problem (0:00 - 1:30)

**[Screen: Split screen showing complex ML code vs frustrated developer]**

**Narrator (Voice Over):**
"Fine-tuning AI models today requires PhD-level expertise. Look at this - hundreds of lines of complex reward function code, RLHF implementations, and black-box optimization."

**[Screen: Code scrolling by - PyTorch, complex loss functions, etc.]**

"Domain experts know WHAT makes good content, but they can't translate that knowledge into model training. The result? Weeks of development, expensive trial-and-error, and models that don't capture real-world quality standards."

**[Screen: Frustrated developer, timeline showing weeks of work]**

"What if we could change this? What if domain experts could directly teach AI models using the same rubrics they use to evaluate human work?"

## üé¨ Scene 2: The ClarityAI Solution (1:30 - 3:00)

**[Screen: ClarityAI logo animation, then web interface]**

**Narrator:**
"Meet ClarityAI - the tool that transforms fine-tuning from rocket science into something as simple as creating a grading rubric."

**[Screen: Live demo - opening the web interface]**

**Demo Person (on camera):**
"I'm Sarah, a technical writing manager with no ML background. Watch me create a rubric to train AI models to write better documentation."

**[Screen: Creating template in web interface]**

"I want documentation that's helpful, clear, has examples, and is the right length. In ClarityAI, I just describe these criteria like a teacher would."

**[Screen: Adding rules one by one]**
- Contains phrase: "example" (weight: 2.0)
- Readability: Grade level 8-10 (weight: 1.5)  
- Word count: 100-500 words (weight: 1.0)
- Sentiment: Positive and encouraging (weight: 1.0)

"That's it. No coding, no complex math - just common sense quality criteria."

## üé¨ Scene 3: Immediate Feedback & Explainability (3:00 - 4:30)

**[Screen: Testing the template with sample text]**

**Sarah:**
"Now let's test this on some sample documentation."

**[Screen: Pasting in good documentation example]**

**[Screen: Results showing 0.85 score with detailed breakdown]**

**Narrator:**
"Unlike traditional fine-tuning, ClarityAI gives immediate, interpretable feedback. Every score comes with detailed reasoning."

**[Screen: Detailed rule breakdown showing]**
- ‚úÖ Contains "example": Found 3 instances
- ‚úÖ Readability: Grade 9.2 (perfect for target audience)
- ‚úÖ Word count: 287 words (within range)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Sentiment: Could be more encouraging

**Sarah:**
"Look at this - it's not just a number. It tells me exactly WHY the text scored well and HOW to improve it. This is explainable AI that actually helps."

**[Screen: Testing with poor documentation example]**

**[Screen: Results showing 0.23 score with specific suggestions]**
- ‚ùå No examples provided
- ‚ùå Too complex (Grade 14.5)
- ‚ùå Too short (45 words)
- Suggestions: "Add concrete examples", "Use simpler language", "Expand with more detail"

## üé¨ Scene 4: Enterprise-Grade Sophistication (4:30 - 5:30)

**[Screen: Switching to academic paper template]**

**Narrator:**
"But ClarityAI isn't just simple - it's sophisticated. Watch this academic paper evaluation."

**[Screen: Academic template with 9 advanced rules]**
- Domain expertise analysis
- Citation quality assessment  
- Argument structure evaluation
- Semantic coherence scoring
- Readability analysis

**[Screen: Evaluating a research paper]**

**[Screen: Rich results with confidence scores and evidence]**

**Narrator:**
"Each rule provides evidence-based scoring with confidence levels. Domain expertise rules check for technical terminology. Citation analysis validates academic rigor. Argument structure ensures logical flow."

**[Screen: Detailed explanations and actionable suggestions]**

"This isn't just scoring - it's AI-powered peer review that scales."

## üé¨ Scene 5: Training & Results (5:30 - 6:30)

**[Screen: Command line showing training process]**

**Sarah:**
"Now comes the magic - using my rubric to actually train an AI model."

**[Screen: `clarity train --template my-template.yaml --model gpt2`]**

**[Screen: Training progress with improving scores]**

**Narrator:**
"The model learns from high-scoring examples, guided by Sarah's domain expertise. No complex reward engineering - just her practical knowledge translated into AI training."

**[Screen: Before/after comparison of model outputs]**

**Before:** "This function does stuff with data."
**After:** "This function processes user data with built-in validation. For example, it checks email formats and sanitizes input to prevent injection attacks."

**Sarah:**
"Look at that improvement! The AI learned to write like our best technical writers - with examples, clear explanations, and security awareness."

## üé¨ Scene 6: The Impact (6:30 - 7:00)

**[Screen: Split screen showing multiple use cases]**

**Narrator:**
"ClarityAI is already transforming how organizations approach AI training:"

**[Screen: Use case montage]**
- Code review automation
- Customer support optimization  
- Academic writing assistance
- Content quality assurance
- Legal document analysis

"From PhD to high school. From weeks to hours. From black box to crystal clear."

**[Screen: ClarityAI logo with tagline]**

"ClarityAI: Train LLMs with teacher-style rubrics."

**[Screen: Call to action]**
