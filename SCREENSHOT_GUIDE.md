## If You're Feeling Ambitious:
Create a simple diagram showing:
```
Domain Expert → YAML Rubric → ClarityAI → Trained AI Model
     ↓              ↓            ↓           ↓
  No ML PhD    Simple Config   Advanced    Better
  Required     (30 minutes)    Processing  Results
```

But honestly, the screenshots above are plenty. Your written submission is so strong that images are just supporting evidence.

**Remember**: You don't need perfection. You need to show that your project works and solves a real problem. These screenshots do exactly that.
