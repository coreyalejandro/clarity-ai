## CI Pipeline

The GitHub Actions CI pipeline includes:

1. **Test Job**:
   - Runs on multiple Python versions (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs linting and type checking
   - Executes tests with coverage reporting
   - Uploads coverage to Codecov

2. **Performance Job**:
   - Runs performance tests
   - Generates performance reports
   - Uploads reports as artifacts

3. **Build Job**:
   - Builds the package
   - Uploads distribution artifacts

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Add more tests for edge cases
   - Increase coverage in trainer module

2. **Enhance Performance Tests**:
   - Add more benchmarks for different model sizes
   - Implement comparative benchmarks

3. **Improve CI Pipeline**:
   - Add deployment workflow
   - Implement automatic version bumping
   - Set up scheduled test runs
