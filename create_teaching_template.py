Step 2: Implement performance monitoring with automated alerting. You should setup query execution tracking and establish baseline performance metrics. Warning: Changes to production systems require proper change management procedures. Step 3: Create backup and disaster recovery procedures following industry best practices.

Step 2: Configure authentication using industry-standard OAuth 2.0 with proper token management. You should implement role-based access controls where doctors have different permissions than administrative staff. Step 3: Setup comprehensive error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information. Warning: Generic error messages prevent information leakage but maintain user experience.

For example, 'Users will be able to configure SSL certificates for production deployment.' Step 1: Write an overview that explains the purpose and context. You should include prerequisites and expected completion time. Step 2: Break complex procedures into numbered steps with specific actions. For instance, 'Run the following command: sudo systemctl restart nginx' rather than 'restart the web server.' Important: Always include troubleshooting sections for common issues. Step 3: Provide working code examples with proper syntax highlighting and explanations. Warning: Test all code examples in a clean environment before publishing. You'll know your documentation is effective when new team members can follow it independently and achieve the stated objectives. Remember: Update documentation immediately when procedures change to maintain accuracy."

Step 1: Begin by establishing baseline performance metrics using monitoring tools. For example, track average query execution time, connection pool usage, and resource consumption. Important: Never optimize production databases without proper backups and rollback procedures. Step 2: Analyze slow query logs to identify performance bottlenecks. You should focus on queries that run frequently or consume significant resources. For instance, SELECT statements without proper WHERE clauses often cause table scans. Step 3: Implement index optimization based on query patterns and data access requirements. Warning: Over-indexing can slow INSERT and UPDATE operations, so balance read and write performance. Step 4: Configure connection pooling and caching strategies appropriate for your application load. You'll know optimization is successful when query response times improve by at least 20%, resource utilization decreases, and application performance monitoring shows consistent improvements. Remember: Always test performance changes in staging environments before production deployment."
