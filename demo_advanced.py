    Machine learning has revolutionized many fields through its ability to learn patterns from data.
    Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, have shown remarkable performance
    in tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing. However, these models
    often suffer from overfitting when training data is limited.
    
    To address this issue, researchers have developed various regularization techniques including
    dropout, batch normalization, and weight decay. Cross-validation is commonly used to evaluate
    model performance and select optimal hyperparameters. The gradient descent optimization
    algorithm, combined with backpropagation, enables efficient training of neural networks.
    
    Recent advances in transformer architectures and attention mechanisms have further improved
    model performance across various domains. These developments demonstrate the importance of
    feature engineering and proper model selection in achieving state-of-the-art results.
