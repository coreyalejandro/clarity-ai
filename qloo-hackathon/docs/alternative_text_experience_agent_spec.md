# Alternative Text Experience Agent Specification
## Dual-Track Multisensory Podcast System

---

## üéØ CORE CONCEPT

**Primary Innovation**: Dual-track audio system where a specialized AI agent provides ongoing multisensory commentary that adapts to the narrative temperature of the main content.

**Revolutionary Approach**: Instead of describing what things look like, we describe how they feel, sound, fit, and make you feel emotionally.

## ü§ñ ALTERNATIVE TEXT EXPERIENCE AGENT

### Agent Core Functions

```python
class AlternativeTextExperienceAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.narrative_temperature_analyzer = NarrativeTemperatureAnalyzer()
        self.multisensory_descriptor = MultisensoryDescriptor()
        self.emotional_resonance_engine = EmotionalResonanceEngine()
        self.cultural_context_provider = CulturalContextProvider()
    
    def adapt_to_narrative_temperature(self, content, mood):
        """Matches description intensity to story emotion"""
        if mood == "intimate": return self.gentle_detailed_descriptions()
        if mood == "energetic": return self.dynamic_sensory_descriptions()
        if mood == "analytical": return self.precise_technical_descriptions()
        if mood == "cultural": return self.respectful_contextual_descriptions()
    
    def provide_multisensory_commentary(self, main_audio):
        """Secondary track with tactile/auditory/emotional context"""
        return {
            "tactile_layer": self.describe_textures_and_fit(),
            "auditory_layer": self.describe_sounds_and_acoustics(),
            "emotional_layer": self.describe_feelings_and_empowerment(),
            "cultural_layer": self.provide_cultural_context()
        }
```

### Multisensory Question Framework Integration

**Fit & Comfort Questions**:
- "How did it fit you? Did the fit make you feel relaxed, empowered, or too casual?"
- "Does the structure support or restrict your movement?"
- "How does the weight distribution feel across your body?"

**Auditory Experience Questions**:
- "Do you like the way they sound when you walk in them?"
- "Do you prefer noisy clothes or quiet ones?"
- "Do noisy clothes make you feel exposed or safe?"

**Environmental Design Questions**:
- "When you decorate your house, do you give each room a different material feel?"
- "In your home office, are the materials harsher to create alertness?"
- "How do different textures affect your mood and productivity?"

## üå°Ô∏è NARRATIVE TEMPERATURE SYSTEM

### Temperature Detection
```python
class NarrativeTemperatureAnalyzer:
    def analyze_content_mood(self, audio_segment):
        return {
            "intimate": self.detect_personal_stories(),
            "energetic": self.detect_excitement_or_trends(),
            "analytical": self.detect_data_or_technical_content(),
            "cultural": self.detect_cultural_discussions(),
            "emotional": self.detect_feelings_or_empowerment_topics()
        }
```

### Temperature-Matched Descriptions

**Intimate Temperature** (Personal stories, individual experiences):
- Gentle, detailed descriptions
- Focus on personal comfort and emotional connection
- Whispered-quality secondary track
- "Imagine the soft weight of cashmere against your shoulders..."

**Energetic Temperature** (Trends, exciting developments):
- Dynamic, movement-focused descriptions
- Emphasis on sounds and kinetic qualities
- Upbeat secondary track pacing
- "Feel the fabric swish with confidence as you stride..."

**Analytical Temperature** (Data, technical content):
- Precise, technical descriptions
- Focus on construction and functional details
- Clear, measured secondary track delivery
- "The flat-fell seams eliminate bulk while providing durability..."

**Cultural Temperature** (Cultural discussions):
- Respectful, contextual descriptions
- Emphasis on cultural significance and meaning
- Reverent secondary track tone
- "This pattern carries generations of cultural meaning..."
