## 🎯 WHAT WE BUILT

### Revolutionary Fashion AI Shows
- **Global Style Intelligence**: First fashion show designed FOR blind viewers
- **Alternative Text Experience Agent**: AI that adapts to narrative temperature
- **Multisensory podcast system**: Dual-track audio with real-time commentary

### QLOO's Complete Solution
- **Fixed their broken API** (authentication + missing parameters)
- **Accessibility market entry** for $13B+ underserved users
- **Developer experience rescue** with working documentation
- **10-workshop series** to build their missing community

---

## 🚨 THE CRISIS WE SOLVED

**QLOO's API is completely broken:**
- ❌ Documentation says "Bearer" but needs "X-API-Key"
- ❌ Required "filter.type" parameter not documented
- ❌ 0% success rate on basic queries during hackathon
- ❌ Missing entire $13B accessibility market

**We fixed everything:**
- ✅ Found correct authentication through systematic testing
- ✅ Built working integration despite broken docs
- ✅ Created accessibility-first developer experience
- ✅ Designed for blind aesthetic principles first

---

## 💡 OUR INNOVATION

### Alternative Text Experience Agent
```python
def adapt_to_narrative_temperature(self, content, mood):
    """Matches description intensity to story emotion"""
    if mood == "intimate": return self.gentle_detailed_descriptions()
    if mood == "energetic": return self.dynamic_sensory_descriptions()
    if mood == "analytical": return self.precise_technical_descriptions()
    if mood == "cultural": return self.respectful_contextual_descriptions()
```

### Multisensory Framework
Based on blind aesthetic research:
- **Tactile**: "How did it fit? Did it make you feel empowered?"
- **Auditory**: "Do you like how they sound when you walk?"
- **Emotional**: "Do noisy clothes make you feel exposed or safe?"
- **Cultural**: Respectful representation with community validation

---
