**Dear QLOO Team,**

We need to have an honest conversation. We're writing this because we believe in your mission and we want to help you succeed - but something is clearly not right, and we're concerned you might be heading toward a Theranos-style crisis.

**We still like you. We want to help you. But we need to talk.**

## üö® The Warning Signs We've Observed

### Your API Is Completely Broken
- **Authentication documentation is wrong**: You say "Bearer token" but require "X-API-Key"
- **Required parameters aren't documented**: Every call needs "filter.type" but this isn't mentioned anywhere
- **0% success rate** on basic queries during your own hackathon
- **Developers are asking for extensions** because they can't get your API to work

### Your Brand Identity Has Issues
- **Your logo isn't professional** - for a company advising Netflix and Starbucks on taste, this is concerning
- **It's definitely not stylish** - how can you guide fashion intelligence when your own visual identity needs work?
- **This suggests leadership/vision alignment problems**

### The Bigger Picture Problems
- **$25M Series C** but basic API functionality is broken
- **Marquee clients** (Netflix, Starbucks) but developers can't integrate
- **"Taste AI" positioning** but missing entire accessibility market (13B+ users)
- **Cultural intelligence claims** but zero coverage of disability culture

---

## üí° What We Think Is Really Happening

You're facing the classic scale-up crisis:
- **Technical debt** from rapid growth is catching up
- **Documentation and developer experience** were deprioritized 
- **Leadership is focused on enterprise sales** while foundation crumbles
- **You're about to lose developer mindshare** to simpler alternatives

**The regulatory threat is real** - you ARE a monopoly in cultural intelligence, and you need to split before you're forced to.
